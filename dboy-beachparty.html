						** Strange sightings on the beach! **

						In recent days, the beaches around the facility has been filled with both scientists and Class-D personell.
						We speculate that this is a new form of public testing of some sort of new experimental drug. 
						The scientists has been spotted giving out bottled liquid they have referred to as "Beer" to the others on the beach.
						Is this a new mindcontrol ploy by the facility management? We will have to see, as the beach "party" is still going on. This is the third conceccutive day they have been at it, so there must be a bigger picture...
