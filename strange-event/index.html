						<div class="contentSubtitle" style="color: yellow;">Unexplained Phenomena at an Undisclosed Location</div>
						<div class="contentDescription">
							<p>
								It was just another evening at the pizzeria. Families gathered, laughter echoed through the dining area, and the scent of freshly baked pizza filled the air. But as the night wore on, a strange and unsettling silence began to creep in.
							</p>
							<p>
								Patrons reported feeling an inexplicable chill, as if the temperature had dropped suddenly. The lights flickered, and an oppressive atmosphere descended over the room. Some described seeing shadows moving in the corners of their eyes, but when they turned to look, there was nothing there.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								By the time the Mobile Task Force arrived, the scene had already taken a darker turn. The details of what occurred remain classified, but whispers suggest that something far more sinister than a power outage had taken place. The team, seasoned and unshaken by the bizarre, found themselves in a situation unlike any they had encountered before.
							</p>
							<p>
								Hidden in the dim recesses of the kitchen, they discovered something. The reports refer to it only as "the creature," a being that defies conventional description. Those who have glimpsed the classified files speak of an entity with an otherworldly presence, something that shouldn't exist in this reality. The few who survived that night recount tales of piercing eyes, a low growl that resonated in their bones, and the overwhelming sense that they were being watched—hunted.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								As the night dragged on, the Task Force worked swiftly to contain the situation. But the aftermath could not be so easily concealed. Civilian accounts were quickly suppressed, the witnesses debriefed, and the scene sanitized before dawn. What became of those who were inside remains a mystery, their names conspicuously absent from official reports.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yet, rumors persist. People talk about loved ones who went out for pizza and never came home. About strange vans that appeared in the early hours of the morning and the men in suits who said it was <i>"just a gas leak."</i> But the locals are not convinced.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								The pizzeria remains closed now, boarded up with no sign of reopening. But every now and then, a light is seen flickering inside, and some claim they can still hear that low growl, echoing through the empty streets.

						<div class="contentTitle">Incident Report: SCP-458 Interaction</div>
						<div class="contentDescription">
							<p>
								<b>Incident Date:</b> [REDACTED]<br>
								<b>Location:</b> Tam's Pizzeria, Undisclosed Location
							</p>
							<p>
								<br><b>Summary:</b><br>
								On the evening of [REDACTED], SCP-458 was reportedly used by an unidentified individual at Tam's Pizzeria, leading to a series of anomalous events that coincided with the mysterious incident documented earlier that night. Witnesses described seeing a seemingly ordinary pizza box appear on one of the tables, shortly before the unexplained phenomena began to manifest.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br><b>Details:</b><br>
								According to security footage recovered from the site, the pizza box materialized without any discernible cause or method of delivery. Shortly after it appeared, the lights in the pizzeria began to flicker, and patrons reported feeling an overwhelming sense of dread. Subsequent investigations confirmed that the box in question was, in fact, SCP-458, as it exhibited its characteristic behavior of generating the holder's preferred pizza upon contact.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, in this instance, the pizza produced by SCP-458 was not consumed. Instead, it remained untouched as the events escalated. The Mobile Task Force on site reported that the box seemed to react to the presence of the unidentified entity found in the kitchen area. At one point, the box was observed to open and close repeatedly on its own, as if attempting to lure the entity towards it. This behavior has never been documented before in SCP-458's previous interactions.
							</p>
							<p>
								During the containment breach, SCP-458 was recovered and returned to Site-17. Notably, the box now appears to resist further attempts at interaction, refusing to produce any pizza for personnel since the incident. The nature of SCP-458's involvement in the events at Tam's Pizzeria remains under investigation, with particular focus on its apparent connection to the unidentified entity.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
								Further testing with SCP-458 has been suspended until more information can be gathered. Personnel are advised to report any unusual behavior observed in SCP-458 immediately. The pizzeria site has been declared off-limits pending a thorough investigation, and all personnel involved have been debriefed and issued Class-A amnestics.

						<div class="contentTitle">Incident Report: Anomalous Entity Encounter</div>
						<div class="contentDescription">
							<p>
								<b>Incident Date:</b> [REDACTED]<br>
								<b>Location:</b> Tam's Pizzeria, Undisclosed Location
							</p>
							<p>
								<bt></bt><b>Summary:</b><br>
								On [REDACTED], an anomalous event was reported at Tam's Pizzeria, involving the sudden appearance of a previously unidentified entity within the establishment. The event occurred several weeks after the initial SCP-458 interaction, raising concerns about a potential pattern of anomalous activity at this location.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br><b>Details:</b><br>
								Witnesses described the entity as humanoid in shape but lacking any discernible facial features or clothing. The entity, referred to as "The Visitor," appeared in the dining area during closing hours. Security footage shows it manifesting out of thin air, followed by an immediate drop in temperature and the spontaneous extinguishing of all light sources in the vicinity.
							</p>
							<p>
								The entity remained stationary for approximately five minutes, during which it was observed to be silently "watching" the empty tables. An unidentified patron, unaware of the anomalous nature of the event, attempted to interact with "The Visitor," resulting in the immediate disappearance of both the entity and the individual. Attempts to trace the missing patron have so far been unsuccessful.
							</p>
							<br><p>
								The Mobile Task Force was deployed to secure the site. Upon arrival, they discovered a series of cryptic symbols etched into the walls of the pizzeria, none of which matched any known language or symbols previously encountered by the Foundation. These symbols appeared to pulse with a faint glow, which diminished upon closer inspection.
							</p>
							<p>
								Containment procedures were initiated, and the area was cleared. The symbols were photographed and subsequently removed for analysis. No further manifestations of "The Visitor" have been reported, but Foundation researchers are currently investigating potential links between this event and the previous SCP-458 incident.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
								The pizzeria remains under close observation, and additional security measures have been implemented. Personnel are advised to avoid the area unless specifically assigned. Further study of the symbols and their possible connection to "The Visitor" is ongoing.
