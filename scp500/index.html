							SCP-500 is coming soon

						<p><br>
							The developers of SCP:SL has finally given in to the voice of the community and are adding SCP-500 into the game.<br>This will definitely help combat cancerous behavior and deafness due to Soviet anthems being played aggressively over the facility intercom.
							<br><br>
							Is that one russian kid on the radio bringing you excruciating mental pain? Look no further, pop an SCP-500 and your problems will be no more.

							What we expect to see in the future
						</div>
						<p>
							Let's face it; as the risk of getting cancer from players decrease, SCP-500 won't be of much use anymore. Seeing SCP-1025 added seems like a no-brainer.
							<br>
							Perhaps we would also see the introduction of a whole new gameplay mechanic where SCP-500 will be introduced as a playable character? At this point, it's hard to say anything for certain. But we do know something big is DEFINITELY in the works over at Hubert's garage.
