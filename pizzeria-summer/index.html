						The heat is on, and the facility invites all its Inabitants to the beach for a Summer Solstice bash!
						<br><br><br><br><br>
						It looks to us as a summer party like no other! They got beach balls, sunshine, and of
						course - pizza!

					** Strange sightings on the beach! **<br><br>
					In recent days, the beaches
					around the facility has been filled with both scientists and Class-D
					personell. We speculate that this is a new form of public testing of
					some sort of new experimental drug. The scientists has been spotted
					giving out bottled liquid they have referred to as "Beer" to the
					others on the beach.
					<br><br>
					Is this a new mindcontrol ploy by the facility
					management? We will have to see, as the beach "party" is still going
					on. This is the third conceccutive day they have been at it, so
					there must be a bigger picture...
